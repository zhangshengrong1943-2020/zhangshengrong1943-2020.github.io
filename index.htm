    <p>I am a first-year doctoral student at

    I am fortunately advised by

    Before joining CMU, I enjoyed four fantasic undergrad years at Tsinghua University, advised by

    I also worked closely with <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/Argo">Jason Eisner</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/" target="_blank">Matt Gormley</a>.
    You can find my cv <a href="http://www.zhuhao.me/static/cv.pdf">here</a> (2019/3).


    </p><p>My ultimate goal is to understand <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/human-intelligence-psychology" target="_blank">human intelligence</a>. Believing in <a href="http://www.richardfeynman.com/" target="_blank">Feynman</a>'s famous quote, "<i>What I cannot create, I do not understand.</i>", I am working on teaching Machine Learning models to gain human intelligence.
      More specifically, I am currently interested in teaching machines to speak human language, as well as to do human-level logical reasoning. I also have broad interests in other cognitive science fields.

        <h5>Iterative Entity Alignment via Joint Knowledge Embeddings</h5>
        <p>Entity alignment aims to link entities and their counterparts among different knowledge graphs. There are two main challenge in this project: (1) How to find synonymous entity counterparts from different knowledge graphs, (2) How to make full use of entity pairs aligned during training. We proposed to embedding both knowledge graphs into joint embedding space and also proposed an iterative method to make use of newly aligned entity pairs.</p>

        <h5>Incorporating Chinese Characters of Words for Lexical Sememe Prediction</h5>
        <p>Sememes are minimum semantic units of concepts in human languages, such that each word sense is composed of one or multiple sememes.
           Words are usually manually annotated with their sememes by linguists and form linguistic common-sense knowledge bases widely used in various NLP tasks.
           Recently, the lexical sememe prediction task was introduced. It consists of automatically recommending sememes for words, which is expected to improve annotation efficiency and consistency.
           However, existing methods of lexical sememe prediction typically rely on the external context of words to represent the meaning, which usually fails to deal with low-frequency and out-of-vocabulary words. To address this issue for Chinese, we propose a novel framework to take advantage of both
             internal character information and external context information of a word.
